    <p> My favourite character is Sisu from the new Disney Movie "Raya and the last Dragon". She was the last dragon until everything changes. Sisu is my favourite character, because she trusts everybody. Even though everybody thought that the others were bad, she still trusted them which made others trust them a well. She is very kind, positive and funny. Sisu was the dragon, who was trusted by her sisters to take the magic and have the last bit of the dragon magic. Sisu is very easy to trust, because when we see her, she doesn't want the bad for anyone. I really like Sisu as my favourite character.</p>
